## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The client is a large American retailer that desires to implement a sales prediction system based on artificial intelligence algorithms.

- [See a detailed technical explanation of project here.](https://pedrocorma.github.io/project/0forecasting/)

## Objectives <a name="objectives"></a>
Developing a set of machine learning models on a three-year-history SQL database to predict sales for the next 8 days at the store-product level using massive modelling techniques.





## Instructions  <a name="instructions"></a>
The project should be run using exactly the same environment in which it was created.

- Project environment can be replicated using 'retail.yml' file which was created during the set up phase of the project. It can be found in the folder '01_Documentos'.
- Copy 'retail.yml' file to the directory and using the terminal or anaconda prompt execute:
    > conda env create --file retail.yml --name project_name

By other hand, remember to update the `project_path` variable of the notebooks to the path where you have replicated the project.
